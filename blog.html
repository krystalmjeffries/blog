    <p>Beauty and the Beast are colliding. A sinner once, a sinner twice. The sound of hooves knock at your door. (1409607566242). Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?. Infamy. No more!. Adrenaline starts to flow. Ah, light it up. Whiplash!. Here again, a captive of the howl. (1409607566242). Better raise your ears. You've come to see the show. OH, YEAH YEAH!</p>

    <p>Decadence. Who cares at all?. All for publicity. Judge not lest ye be judged yourself. We do our best, you're the rest. You. High again. Tapped out. Holier than thou. Am I savage?. (1409607566242). Doused in the gasoline. Little whispers circle around your head. The pathway starts to spiral. The high times going timeless</p>

    <p>Sharpened edge touch liquid flame. Light it up. Yesterday. Built a higher wall. You know it's all been planned. Like you never did before. The Horsemen are drawing nearer. Ooooh. Or choose your fate and die. Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatine. Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue. Run away, the past will bite again. Blacked out. Faithful, as the full moon is rising. That drives you fuckin' mad</p>
